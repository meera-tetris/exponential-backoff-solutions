Exponential Backoff Demo (Python + Docker)
This project shows a simple implementation of exponential backoff with jitter.
The script keeps retrying a request when it fails, waiting longer each time:

1s → 2s → 4s → 8s …


Jitter adds a small random delay so all retries don’t hit the server at the same time.
